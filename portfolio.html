<p>I bring to bear my psychology research skills and expertise on user experience research and design. There are myriad applications for cognitive, social, and organizational psychology to the practice of user experience. Being a scientist-practitioner at heart, I seek to apply the methods and results of research to real world problems. In my UX work, I translate user research results (quantitative and qualitative) into tangible artifacts to communicate with my team, including behavior/task flow charts, use case scenarios, wireframes, mockups, interactive prototypes, and functional prototypes.</p>
<p>Here is a selection of my user experience work, with a bit of design. Each piece provides an overview of the piece and description of my design process. Most of these pieces are personal projects. Much of my professional UX work is proprietary and cannot be presented publicly, but I would be happy to discuss my data visualization, information architecture, and interface design work.</p>
