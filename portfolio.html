<p>I bring to bear my psychology research skills and expertise on user experience research and design. There are myriad applications for cognitive, social, and organizational psychology to the practice of user experience. Being a scientist-practitioner at heart, I seek to apply the methods and results of research to real world problems. In my UX work, I translate user research results (quantitative and qualitative) into tangible artifacts to communicate with my team, including behavior/task flow charts, use case scenarios, wireframes, mockups, interactive prototypes, and functional prototypes.</p>
<p>Here is a selection of my user experience work. Each piece provides an overview of the piece and description of my design process. Most of these pieces are personal projects. Much of my professional UX work is proprietary and cannot be presented publicly, but I would be happy to discuss my data visualization, information architecture, and interface design work.</p>

                Based on an old blog post, I created an interactive data visualization to compare the 2016 presidential candidates on their coverage of the issues. I researched how many issues each candidate addresses on their site and how many words are devoted to each issue. Visualization built in JavaScript with aid of c3.js.

                For awhile I've maintained a living list of guiding principles for my UX work. The principles are a synthesis of established UX thought, applications of psychological research, and personal experience. Rather than keeping it in my head and on various white boards, I've formalized it as post on zachsteiner.com.
