<p>I collaborated with the Creative Director to craft a new corporate site. This site contains marketing, sales, and career information separate from <a href="https://theodysseyonline.com">theodysseyonline.com</a>. The business required that content easily updated, so I crafted a solution in Jekyll with <a href="https://www.siteleaf.com">Siteleaf</a> as a CMS. All sections are built from posts or collections, such that the content is abstracted from the layouts. This allows for easy changes or reordering of content. All interactivity uses CSS animation and HTML inputs, without need for JavaScript. This project allowed me to experiment with video backgrounds, animations, and non-JS interactivity. The scrolling screenshots were a particularly fun challenge. They are constructed with a phone frame image and extra long screenshots of the site that scroll with CSS transforms and animation.</p>
