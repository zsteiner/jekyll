<p>I collaborated with the Creative Director to craft a new corporate site. This site contains marketing, sales, and career information separate from <a href="https://theodysseyonline.com">theodysseyonline.com</a>. The business required that content needed to be updated easily, so I crafted a solution in Jekyll with <a href="https://www.siteleaf.com">Siteleaf</a> available for updates. All sections are built from posts or collections, such that the content is abstracted from the layouts. This allows for easy changes or recording of content. All interactivity uses CSS animation and HTML, without need for JavaScript. This project allowed me to experiment with video background, animations, and non-JS interactivity. The scrolling screenshots were a particularly fun challenge. They are made with a phone frame image and extra long screenshots of the site that scroll with CSS animation.</p>
