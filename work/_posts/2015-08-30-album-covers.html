description: I have a handful of albums in iTunes that don't have cover art and a few (namely some classical titles) that have really uninspiring artwork. I created a set of covers using typographic layouts, illustration, and found artwork or photography. It was an opportunity to experiment with a range of aesthetics and layout techniques.

    <h2>Bach: Piano Transcriptions & Trio Sonatas</h2>
    <p>"Piano Transcriptions" is my first in the series. It's a compilation from my friend Ali, so it simply had a Bach portrait until now. I decided to replace the mediocre "Trio Sonatas" to match. I substituted stylized piano with stylized organ pipes.</p>

    <h2>Beethoven: Trios</h2>
    <p>The original is pretty uninspired. Given the recordings were in the late 1920s, I took some cues from Futurism for two variants.</p>

    <h2>Prince Bootlegs and Rarities</h2>
    <p>These are covers for a few bootlegs and rarities from my Prince collection. Crystal Ball and Dream Factory are unreleased albums from the late 80s. The Truth is an "acoustic" album bundled as a bonus disc with the box set Crystal Ball (not the same as unreleased album). Crystal Ball features a lovely microscopic image of crystals. The Truth is a riff off a underwhelming unofficial cover.</p>

    <h2>Ives: Central Park in the Dark</h2>
    <p>This is an orphan with the Symphonies broken out. I found a lovely turn of the century of Central Park (probably not in the dark).</p>

    <h2>Stravinsky: Rite of Spring</h2>
    <p>The recording is from the mid 1980s, so the art could use some updating. I did play around with a variant featuring a Patrick Nagel illustration to go full 80s (think Duran Duran's Rio), but alas it's a proprietary image.</p>

    <h2>Takemitsu: Music of Takemitsu</h2>
    <p>I've had this CD since the late 90s and always hated the art. I did two variants with different woodblock prints.</p>

    <h2>Les Catacombes, Paris 1969</h2>
    <p>Live recording without a cover featuring Chick Corea, John McLaughlin, Dave Holland, and Jack DeJohnette. Two variants playing around with 1960s styles. </p>
