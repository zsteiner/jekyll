I'm Zach Steiner. I received my Ph.D in Industrial/Organizational Psychology from Colorado State University and then moved into user experience. Currently, I'm Director of Research & Development at [Luther Consulting][1], a public health software company in Indianapolis, IN.

I play saxophone, guitar, bass, and a bit of piano.
