It seems so obvious now, but Jekyll provides the ability to have posts in multiple categories (directories). Rather than manually managing my portfolio page, I can now create "posts" for each piece. This makes managing everything much easier to manage and removed the awkward redirect from <http://portfolio.zachsteiner.com>. Everything is now under one roof, as originally intended. Also, the few applications I wrote have their own subdomains (e.g. <http://merge.zachsteiner.com> ).

The next step is to have linear navigation that is separate for blog posts and portfolio pieces.
