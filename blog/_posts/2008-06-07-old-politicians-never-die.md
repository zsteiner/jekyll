;they only get forwarded... 

I was curious about what happens to old political websites when the candidate has not been running for several years. All of the 2008 candidates still have active sites because it's too soon, but what of the 2004 candidates?

[www.howarddean.com][1] forwards to the wikipedia page about Howard Dean. Much easier than maintaining a page! 

[www.wesleyclark.com][2] forwards to a strange site called "Common Nonsense." However, [www.clark04.com ][3] is still an active page.

[www.denniskucinich.com][4] oddly goes to a 2004 page, not page for his more recent bid for president.

Strangest of all, [www.johnkerry.com][5] goes nowhere. I guess it's fitting...
