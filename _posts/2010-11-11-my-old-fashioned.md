Muddling oranges and cherries and adding sprite are common travesties that force me to avoid the Old Fashioned at bars. A stirred Manhattan on the rocks is a decent substitute.

My Old Fashioned is a slight variation on this [excellent recipe][1]:

**Ingredients:**

2 oz of single barrel or small batch bourbon (I like [Evan Williams 10 year][2] or [Elijah Craig][3] for a good reasonable bottle)

2 sugar cubes (better with natural sugar)

2 to 3 dashes of Angostura Bitters

3 to 4 Maraschino cherries (Optional, but I like to eat them at the end of the drink. You can substitute a slice of lemon or orange.)

**Preparation:**

Add bitters to cubes in bottom of Old Fashioned glasses with a splash of water (or club soda if you have it). Crush sugar with bar spoon; then, stir until the sugar dissolves. Add bourbon and swirl to stir. A few ice cubes and cherries. Let ice melt as long as you can hold off, before enjoying.
