This is a follow up to my [previous post][1]

I received another suspicious text message about Ask Mozoot the other night. The next morning, I checked my AT&T account and there was another $9.99 charge for Ask Mozoot. I called AT&T again and asked what was going on. It turns out that purchase blocking *is* available for iPhone. The previous customer service rep said it was not available. His misinformation was based on the fact that the blocking service does not work in iTunes, but does block all mobile "purchases," such as Ask Mozoot. iTunes does not trick you into buying things, so it's not an issue. I added purchase blocking to my account. Though, it's taking several calls and several confusing bills. Carriers should make purchase blocking (at least pin validated) default, but that would  cut into their profits (similar to this scheme http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/verizon-how-much-do-you-charge-now/)

**My advice**: Be proactive and add purchase blocking to your cell account. It's free for AT&T and I would imagine is for other carriers as well.
